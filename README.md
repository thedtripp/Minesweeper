## Description
An ancient logic game which has been stumping puzzle lovers since 1992. We have coded a logical agent to play (and win) this game. As the agent uncovers squares, it builds a knowledge base and makes inferences about which squares are safe and which squares contain mines. As the agent examines the safe squares, more areas are opened. Sometimes, the agent is unable to determine whether a square is safe or not. In the case, advanced tactics for a probabilistic treatment of forced guesses are employed.
